# OCC-Media
Scripts I use for processing media I capture for reviews

I use BATCH files for controlling FFmpeg and Imagemagick to process videos and images respectively

To create the YouTube thumbnails, Inkscape is used first for the original SVG the script works from, and then to actually create the PNG
